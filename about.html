            <p>ABOUT ME</p>
        </div>
        <p class="aboutSpacing">Hey there! My name is Mareson, or as my friends call me, Mareson. I’m a high school student exploring UI / UX, design, and code. This website is just for that, to learn and apply my knowledge in a creative way. Additionally, I plan to build a
            portfolio and blog and place it here. I’ll be updating this website pretty often and I hope you stick for those updates. </p>
        <p class="aboutSpacing">As a kid I loved to draw and play games like minecraft. I’ve always liked making things, simply put, nice to look at yet new. That’s led me down the path to design. I've spent time working on small design projects, and decided to make a website,
            learn as much as I can during quarantine, and explore new ideas.</p>
        <p class="aboutSpacing"> Other than that, my other hobbies include playing games, gardening, science - especially space, music, drawing, editing, and film. <br> <br> I plan to further develop my skills, and either major in design or computer science. From there? Well,
            guess I’ll just have to find out.
